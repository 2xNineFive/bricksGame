This is the interface I created for the Bricks game.

This interface is based on the Grid layout. The first <em>div</em> is a header and is followed by a <em>div "container"</em>. This container is formatted into a 12-column grid, and the size of each column is "1fr" so that this interface is responsive. 

Each column is assigned a class that determines its color, meanwhile each row is comprised of a column with a color or a set of colors. 

Creating this interface was challenging... and I enjoyed it! I struggled with formatting the "white" dots inside of the two "black boxes." My initial ideas were not working and I could not find any solutions online. Then a random thought popped in my head that I should try to reduce the font-size of the container to make the divs "wrap properly." And it worked! It felt amazing that I was able to figure that out. I gained the confidence to tackle bugs. 

Another bug I dealt with was the header. My goal was to position the "score and points" div classes into a specific spot and maintain responsiveness. None of the position methocs in CSS were giving me the result I wanted. Then, an idea came to mind that I should just create empty divs and then use the "fr" method to place my "score and points" where I wanted them to be. That also worked! 

I feel great after completing this assignment!

The last thing to do is to round all the corners. I tried applying a "border-radius" to all my divs, but that created some bugs. I wonder if it is possible to exclude certain divs from a style. That would make this task super easy.
